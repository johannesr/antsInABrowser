This is a ant farm based on Langton's ant rules which with a very simple set of rules create complicated emergent behavior.
The players are represendted by a ant and their goal is to escape the farm.

The rules of the game:

1. If the ant is on a black square, it turns right  and moves forward one unit.
2. If the ant is on a white square, it turns left  and moves forward one unit.
3. When the ant leaves a square, it inverts the color.
